PF19722;SENP3_5_N;Zn_chelatase;CL0687;Sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) reversibly regulate the covalent modification of proteins by SUMO. SENP3 and 5 share considerable sequence homology and exhibit similar substrate specificity, as they are active against SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 but less so for SUMO-1. They are more closely related than to SENP1/2. This entry covers the N-terminal domain of SENP5, which contains a conserved region directly preceding the catalytic domain, which is shared with SENP3. This domain is responsible for the subcellular localisation [1]. SENP3 and 5 colocalise in the nucleolus and their depletion causes defects in ribosome biogenesis [2].;True

PF05792;Candida_ALS;Zn_chelatase;CL0687;This family consists of several agglutinin-like proteins from different Candida species. ALS genes of Candida albicans encode a family of cell-surface glycoproteins with a three-domain structure. Each Als protein has a relatively conserved N-terminal domain, a central domain consisting of a tandemly repeated motif of variable number, and a serine-threonine-rich C-terminal domain that is relatively variable across the family. The ALS family exhibits several types of variability that indicate the importance of considering strain and allelic differences when studying ALS genes and their encoded proteins [1]. Fungal adhesins, which include sexual agglutinins, virulence factors, and flocculins, are surface proteins that mediate cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. It is possible that both the serine/threonine-rich domain and the cysteine residues in the C-terminal and DIPSY Pfam:PF11763 participate in anchoring the terminal domains inside the wall, so that only the inner part of Map4p, including the repeat region, is sticking out as a fold-back loop then able to act in adhesing [3].;True

S100P is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins and there have been several recent reports of its over-expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In situ hybridisation shows S100PBPR transcripts to be found in islet cells but not duct cells of the healthy pancreas.

PF14973;TINF2_N;Zn_chelatase;CL0687;This is the N-terminus of TERF1-interacting nuclear factor 2. It is required for the formation of the shelterin complex. The shelterin complex is involved in the protection and maintenance of telomeres [1-3].;True
PF10601;zf-LITAF-like;Zn_chelatase;CL0687;Members of this family display a conserved zinc ribbon structure [1] with the motif C-XX-C- separated from the more C-terminal HX-C(P)X-C-X4-G-R motif by a variable region of usually 25-30 (hydrophobic) residues. Although it belongs to one of the zinc finger's fold groups (zinc ribbon), this particular domain was first identified in LPS-induced tumour necrosis alpha factor (LITAF) which is produced in mammalian cells after being challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)[2]. The hydrophobic region probably inserts into the membrane rather than traversing it. Such an insertion brings together the N- and C-terminal C-XX-C motifs to form a compact Zn2+-binding structure [3].;True

Proper function of the BRCA1 RING domain is critical, as evidenced by the many cancer-predisposing mutations found within this domain. A dimer is formed between the RING domains of BRCA1 and BARD1. The BRCA1-BARD1 structure provides a model for its ubiquitin ligase activity, illustrates how the BRCA1 RING domain can be involved in associations with multiple protein partners and provides a framework for understanding cancer-causing mutations at the molecular level [1]. The corresponding BRCA1-RING domain is on family zf-C3HC4_2, Pfam:PF13923.;True

PF16079;Phage_holin_5_2;Zn_chelatase;CL0687;Phage_holin_V_2 is a family of small hydrophobic proteins with three transmembrane domains of the Hol44 family. These proteins are produced by double-stranded DNA bacteriophages that use an endolysin-holin strategy to achieve lysis of their hosts. The endolysins are peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes that are usually accumulated in the cytosol until access to the cell wall substrate is provided by the holin membrane lesion. Full activity of the endolysin Lys44 from oenophage fOg44 requires sudden ion-nonspecific dissipation of the proton motive force, undertaken by the fOg44 holin during phage-infection [1,2,3].;True
